                        My teaching philosophy is centered around the student themselves instead of the content. What I mean by that is that
                        I prioritize getting an understanding of the students learning style, their strengths, and areas that they need to working on.

                    <h3>
                        Every student is different, which is why sometimes standardized teaching doesn't work for some.
                        Knowing a student allows me to optimize their learning experience for them to make the most out of the session but most importantly
                        remember what they learned and be able to apply the skills during an exam.

                        Being a tutor may involve teaching but I have found that I have personally learned a lot of things through this experience. Tutoring has 
                        definitely nourished my communication skills. Having to convey the solution to an advanced math problem, or the meaning behind a piece of
                        classic literature is not easy and it takes skill to communicate these in a understandable way.

                <div class="mainimg">
                    <h3>
                        Tutoring has also made me a better leader. Guiding students to achieve their desired scores takes work. Simply explaining solutions to students
                        often does not work and in order for them to learn I had to learn to take initiative during sessions and be able to improvise and adapt on the
                        spot for the students needs.
